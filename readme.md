## Algorithms

Some algorithms I programmed in Java while following [this course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb). More to be expected in the future.

Please don't refer to these as perfect/optimal solutions - they are merely tested. My goal is learning by coding. Any contribution is much appreciated.
